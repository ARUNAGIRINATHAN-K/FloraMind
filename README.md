## 🌸 **FloraMind — Intelligent Flower Classifier**

### **Overview**

**FloraMind** is a full-stack web application that demonstrates the practical use of **machine learning in a real-world scenario**. It allows users to input flower measurements such as **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width** through a clean, responsive **Bootstrap-based interface**. The application then predicts the flower species using a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm implemented via the **PHP-ML library**.

### **Key Features**

* 🌼 **Interactive Input Interface:**
  A user-friendly HTML + Bootstrap form for entering flower measurements with real-time validation and preview powered by JavaScript.

* 🤖 **Machine Learning Classification:**
  The backend uses the **Iris dataset (CSV-loaded)** to train and test a **KNN model**, predicting species such as *Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolor*, or *Iris Virginica*.

* 🎨 **Visual Output:**
  Results are displayed dynamically with **CSS-styled visuals**, including icons, color themes, and informative text for each predicted class.

* 💾 **Prediction Logging:**
  Each prediction, along with the user’s input data and timestamp, is saved to a **MySQL database**, teaching **data persistence and model feedback storage**.

* 📊 **Analytics Dashboard (optional extension):**
  An admin view can summarize past predictions, providing basic statistics and usage insights.
